    comment: "I had an outstanding experience at Pedro's Barbershop! The shop is not only clean and well-kept, but the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The staff is incredibly friendly, and they really take the time to listen to what you want. My barber, Pedro, gave me a perfect haircut with great attention to detail, and I left feeling refreshed and confident. It's clear that they take pride in providing excellent service in a comfortable, positive environment.",
